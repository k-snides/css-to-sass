### CSS to Sass
#### (Using the Responsive Layout project)

CSS to Sass is the 5th project of 12 in the TreeHouse Front End Web Development TechDegree.

In this project you will convert a CSS stylesheet to Sass. You'll refactor the stylesheet from the "Responsive Layout" project using SCSS partials, variables, extends, and mixins.


#### The Responsive Layout Project

The Responsive Layout Project was the 2nd project of 12 in the TreeHouse Front End Web Development TechDegree.

The requirements for that project were:

In this project you'll build a responsive, mobile-first layout using HTML and CSS. The design should respond to small, medium, and large viewport sizes and devices; and demonstrate an understanding of responsive design.

You will write basic layout styles to style the page for a small mobile device first. Then, using media queries, add breakpoints to adjust the layout for wider tablet and desktop screens.

A mockup was provided. Instructions were to match the mockup on small, medium and large viewports without any code provided.
